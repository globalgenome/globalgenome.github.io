This is the first post testing out the feasibility of GitHub Pages for hosting a Global Genome Initiative (GGI) blog!

The GGI blog was originally hosted on the NMNH Typepad account, which is now defunct. Here are some examples of previous blog posts:

- [Spiders, Snakes, and Other Creatures that can Bite](http://nmnh.typepad.com/100years/2015/08/spiders-snakes-and-other-creatures-that-can-bite.html)
- [Collecting Insects in Argentina](http://nmnh.typepad.com/100years/2015/07/collecting-insects-in-argentina.html)
- [Collecting Asilioid Flies for Genomic Research](http://nmnh.typepad.com/asiloidflies/2015/11/collecting-asiloid-flies-for-genomic-research.html)

GGI is currently posting blog posts on the [GGI Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/ggismithsonian/). Check out our latest updates there!
